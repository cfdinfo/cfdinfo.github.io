## The Preparation Phase 
I started preparing for JEE Advanced right after my class 12 board exams ended in March. My primary focus was on practicing previous year question papers and honing my speed and accuracy in solving questions within the stipulated time limit. I would solve at least 3 full tests every week under timed conditions to get accustomed to the high pressure environment of the actual exam. 
In addition to practicing tests, I attended offline coaching and devoted 6-7 hours daily for self-studies and revision. I ensured I understood concepts from a [fundamental level](https://channel15.github.io/2023-12-28-the-complete-batman-arkham-collection-experience/) rather than relying on rote learning. Regular doubt clearing sessions with peers and mentors helped identify my weak areas which I focused on improving. 
### Mastering the Maths Basics
While maths always came naturally to me, I knew JEE Advanced tested mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities far beyond the school level. I brush up my basics with extra practice on topics like **calculus, coordinate geometry, vectors, 3D geometry** etc. This helped strengthen my math foundation and build speed simultaneously.

### Chemistry Mechanisms Demystified  
Chemistry was one of my comparatively weaker subjects. I devoted extra self-study time on topics that involved understanding reaction mechanisms like **stereochemistry, coordination compounds, electrochemistry** etc. Explaining concepts to classmates verbally helped solidify my understanding greatly.
## The D-Day Arrives
After months of dedicated preparation, the big day for JEE Advanced finally arrived. I reached the exam center well in time to relax my nerves with some light fun activities. Upon entering the examination hall, I was calmed by my prepared mental state and approach the paper in a focused yet stress-free manner.
### Paper 1: A Confident Start  
The first few questions in Paper 1 tested my comfort with basic math and physics calculations. Solving them correctly gave me the boost to tackle subsequent tricky questions with optimism. Though the initial phase of **Paper 1 went smoothly**, tougher questions towards the end drained some time. Overall, I was satisfied with my performance.
### Refreshment and Motivation 
During the break between papers, I chatted with fellow aspirants and family members who encouraged me to stay focused for Paper 2 as well. A light meal helped refuel my energies for the upcoming challenges.
### Paper 2: Testing Mettle Under Pressure
True to its reputation, Paper 2 presented a higher difficulty level compared to Paper 1. Questions tested not just theoretical understanding but also quick logical thinking abilities. The initial surge of tough questions caused some panic but I regained composure by remembering my rigorous practice regime. Smartly prioritizing easy questions first helped maximize marks in the time crunch situation. Though a few **math multiple choice questions proved difficult to solve,** I was content with navigating Paper 2 successfully in the end.
## The Aftermath and Future Plans
With the culmination of JEE Advanced, a phase of rest and relaxation ensued. Breaking down concepts with peers proved helpful to evaluate our performances as well as room for improvement in the future. While awaiting results patiently, I started freshening up basics for further entrance exams like NDA, BITSAT etc.  
A career in one of the prestigious **IITs had been my long-cherished dream** ever since school days. When results were finally declared a month later, I was ecstatic to have secured an AIR of 4186 - enabling me to pursue my dream B.Tech program from a top IIT college. However, there is still scope for progress and I will continue honing my skills through the undergraduate years as well to set foot into the **cutting-edge domains of research and development.**
