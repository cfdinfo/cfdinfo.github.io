Johnny Carson had a long and illustrious career as the king of late night TV, but hosting The Tonight Show wasn't without its controversies. Carson wasn't afraid to ruffle feathers and assert his authority over the guest list and format of the show. Many performers butted heads with Carson or were ultimately banned over the years.
### # [Rock Musicians Had a Rocky Relationship with Carson](https://thetopnews.github.io/dealing-with-a-green-thumb-mother/) 
In the early days of The Tonight Show, Carson wasn't keen on booking rock artists as guests. He felt rock music didn't fit the  style and tone of the show. **"That's not our kind of music"** were Carson's words expressing his reluctance to feature rock bands. While some rock acts did end up appearing when guest hosts were filling in, Carson's skepticism of rock was well known. It wasn't until the 1980s that he began loosening his stance as rock music dominated popular culture. However, Carson never fully embraced or **understood rock and roll** like younger generations did. One amusing anecdote showed just how out of touch Carson was - after introducing ZZ Top as the musical guest, he genuinely seemed amazed by the audience's loud cheers and asked **"You ever heard of 'em?"**

### # **Joan Rivers Pays the Price for Leaving The Tonight Show**
No feud was more infamous than the one between Johnny Carson and Joan Rivers. Rivers had been a frequent guest host and friend of Carson's for years. But in 1986, she made a crucial error in Carson's eyes by launching her own competing late night talk show without properly notifying him first. When Rivers phoned Carson as a courtesy to tell him about her new show, he flatly refused to take her call. Their friendship was ruined, and Carson banned Rivers from The Tonight Show for many years. It was a powerful message that Carson did not take lightly to any perceived disloyalty or threat to his late night throne. Rivers' career suffered greatly from Carson's wrath, and they remained estranged until his death.
### # **A Brief but Awkward Encounter with "The King of Late Night"** 
As part of an executive training program, a group was able to attend a live Tonight Show taping and meet Carson backstage. At first, everything seemed to be going smoothly. Carson's sidekick Ed McMahon warmly greeted the group and told them to stick around after to meet Carson. However, when Ed introduced the group to Carson, the host didn't say a word for several long seconds. He then bluntly declared "NO WAY" before storming off, making his disinterest perfectly clear. It soured the experience for the group who had eagerly looked forward to the chance encounter. The cold shoulder showed a less appealing side of Carson's personality and reign as the monolith of late night television.
### Bob Hope Stymied by Carson's Control Freak Tendencies  
Another performer who butted heads with Carson's micromanaging ways was veteran entertainer Bob Hope. As one of the true giants of comedy, Hope commanded immense respect in the industry. However, Carson tried to assert control during Hope's appearances that the seasoned comic didn't appreciate. Hope preferred an improvisational interview style while Carson pushed for strict scripting. Their differing approaches created friction backstage. Carson also didn't tolerate Hope going over his allotted appearance time or violating other rules. On multiple occasions, Hope ignored the time limits and instructions, brining prepared video clips against Carson's wishes. While Hope's status meant Carson couldn't outright ban him, it's clear the two clashed creatively and had a tense working relationship.
### # **The Fallout from a Snide Remark about The Byrds**
Guest hosts had to mind their words even more carefully around controversial musical acts. Comedian Bob Newhart found this out the hard way one night in the 1960s. Filling in for Carson, Newhart couldn't help himself from dryly remarking about folk rock group The Byrds following their performance: **"I see you guys let your hair grow."** It was an offhand slight alluding to the band members' long hair at a time when rockers were still viewed as unconventional by mainstream audiences. Newhart's quip ignited parental complaints to the show. It served as an example of how closely Carson watched over guest hosts upholding the proper image and tone of The Tonight Show under his command.
### # **Drama Unfolds Backstage at The Tonight Show**  
Behind the glossy curtain of The Tonight Show, there was no shortage of power struggles, bruised egos, and interpersonal disputes unfolding between Carson and various guests. While audiences saw the effortless charm and humor of Carson's hosting each evening, the reality was that he micromanaged countless aspects and exerted a level of control that inevitably rubbed some performers the wrong way. For all of his comedic talents, Carson also had a mercurial personality and demanded absolute authority, which prevented some creative talents from truly flourishing as guests. The backstage politics and bans handed out revealed the competitive and cliquish underbelly of putting on the highest rated talk show for 30 years.
### Carson Achieves Late Night Domination but at the Cost of Burning Bridges  
Over three decades as the face of NBC's The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson cemented his status as the "King of Late Night." He broke new ground, created enduring comedy bits and inspired countless new generations of stand-up comics and hosts. However, in maintaining his preeminence at the top of the late night ratings, Carson did not shy away from burnishing his image at the cost of severing ties with associates or banning perceived threats. While boosting the profile of the show, his controlling personality and willingness to wield power in volatile feuds fueled as much drama and controversy as the actual humor and celebrity guests. By asserting and demanding near-dictatorial levels of obedience and loyalty from guests, writers and management, Carson ensured total command of his kingdom, but left burned bridges in his wake.
### # **Rising Talents Take Over Late Night After Carson's Departure**
After 30 legendary years, Carson finally stepped down from The Tonight Show in 1992. In the decades hence, younger comics like David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Fallon and others assumed the mantle as they looked to put their own comedic stamp on the enduring franchise. But they all stood on the shoulders of Carson, who practically invented the modern late night format and talk show genre. Even with his penchant for feuding and exerting stiff control, Carson remained a comic genius who dominated pop culture for generations. While newer hosts have adopted looser, more conversational interviews styles, Carson's early reign demonstrated how both dynamism and dictatorship could make for compelling late night TV drama.
