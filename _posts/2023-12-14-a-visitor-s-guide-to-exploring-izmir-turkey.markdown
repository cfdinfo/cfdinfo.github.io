## Unusual Sights and Rich Culture Await in Izmir
### A Glimpse into Local Language and Tradition
As a first time visitor from India, you may find some unusual sights in Izmir. The Turkish script resembles English letters but pronunciation differs slightly. For example, while 'c' sounds like 'j', vowels are emphasized. Interestingly, Turkish grammar structure is similar to many Indian languages with subject-object-verb word order. About 98% of locals practice Islam but headscarves are less common than expected, especially in western regions considered more modern. The legacy of **Mustafa Kemal Atatürk**, Turkey's secularizing president, remains influential today.
